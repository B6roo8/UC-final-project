# Idea

My idea is to help the Muslim parents community to find movies / Tv shows that are suitable for their children so they don't get affected by the European mindset, we need to save our children from those thoughts, so I made this website for  shows so parents can check and review for others to see if there is any innappropiate clip or a hidden idea that can affect your child in the future.

# Future Work 

I want to be able to add all type of shows with their genre, and for the website to be represntable in a better way, I also want to add a favorite list so they can add a show they want to watch in the future or already watched, and lastly a block list, where the parent can block a show they will never watch because they don't like the idea behind it and it will never pop up infront of them

As for the future there is no clear idea of what I'll do, maybe I'll do a renting website for Kuwait, or I'll continue doing websites that helps parenting and help building a great place for our children to prevent them from being corrupted by the ideas that are not allowed in Islam
